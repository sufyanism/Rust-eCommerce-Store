# Rust eCommerce Project
An eCommerce store built in Rust is high performance and secure while handling large traffic and transaction volumes. The store will have to manage things like products, users, orders, inventory, and payments etc.

## Features
* High performance: Ensures a good performance for the store, even under a high load.
* Memory safety: Common bugs such as null pointer dereferencing, buffer overflows, and race conditions are eliminated, making an application safer and more stable.
* Concurrency: Handle multiple simultaneous users or operations, which is very important for eCommerce platforms, especially during peak hours.

## Prerequisites
Step 1: Set Up the Project “edit name as per choice”
First, create a new Rust project:
* `cargo new rust_web_app_main`
* `cd rust_web_app_main`
* `cargo run`
*  `cargo update`
